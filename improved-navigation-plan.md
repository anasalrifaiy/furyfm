# UI/UX Improvement Plan for FuryFM

## Current Issues
- Too many menu items (14 cards) requiring lots of scrolling
- No clear categorization
- Hard to find specific features quickly
- Notifications moved to top, which helped

## Proposed Solution: Bottom Navigation + Categorized Tabs

### Bottom Navigation Bar (5 main sections)
1. **Home** 🏠 - Dashboard with quick stats
2. **Team** 👥 - Squad, Formation, Training, Coaching, Facilities
3. **Match** ⚽ - Friendly, Pro League, Match History
4. **Market** 💰 - Transfer Market, Bank
5. **Social** 👥 - Friends, Leaderboard, Profile

### Benefits
- **Fixed bottom nav** - Always visible, no scrolling needed
- **Categorized content** - Related features grouped together
- **Less scrolling** - Each section shows only relevant items
- **Mobile-app feel** - Familiar pattern for users
- **Quick access** - Max 2 taps to reach any feature

### Implementation
1. Add bottom nav bar component
2. Reorganize menu items into categories
3. Each category shows its own sub-menu
4. Keep notification bell in top-right
5. Maintain gradient design theme

Would you like me to implement this design?
